## About The Project

I'm a Scream fanatic so this Web App is unofficial promo for the 6th movie that premieres March 10th.

Disclaimer: I do not own the Scream franchise. I am simply a fan.

## About The Film

If you aren't familiar with the series, see below for a quick synposis:

The "Scream" movie series, created by Wes Craven, is a modern classic in the horror genre. The first movie was released in 1996, and it quickly gained a cult following for its self-aware humor and meta-commentary on the horror genre. The franchise follows the character of Sidney Prescott, who becomes the target of a series of murders by a masked killer known as Ghostface. With its iconic mask and sharp wit, the "Scream" series has become a staple of horror movie culture and has influenced countless movies and TV shows in the years since its release.
